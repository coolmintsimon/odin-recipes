This is an exercise from the Odin Project to create a barebones website
using HTML and CSS (no JavaScript). The site is to contain culinary recipes.

The exercise demonstrates my knowledge of the basics of HTML including
HTML boilerplate code, tags, elements, attributes, ordered and unordered
lists, links to other pages, and embedded images. It also shows my basic
familiarity with CSS including attribute selectors and class selectors.
