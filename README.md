This is an exercise from the Odin Project to create a barebones website
using HTML (no CSS or JavaScript). The site is to contain culinary recipes.

The exercise demonstrates my  knowledge of the basics of HTML including
HTML boilerplate code, tags, elements, attributes, ordered and unordered
lists, links to other pages, and embedded images.
