        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Greek salad is the <strong>quintessential</strong> Mediterranean salad and is incredibly easy to put together in no time.<br>
            Tangy, crunchy, combining various textures, the Greek salad is a light dish <em>perfectly</em> suited for the hot summer<br>
            months and pairs perfectly with roast chicken or beef as a side dish. Although the salad contains no lettuce,<br>
            it is just as refreshing with the added bonus of keeping well in the fridge.
