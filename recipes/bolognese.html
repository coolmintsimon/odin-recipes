        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>The classic Italian spaghetti bolognese is a <em>must</em> for any home cook worth their salt to have as part of their repertoire.<br>
        This particular recipe is a traditional take on the dish and includes all the essential elements: the meat, the <em>soffritto</em>, and <br>
        wine among other things while remaining adaptable in more ways than one. Beware that for the best results the sauce<br>
        should simmer for <strong>at least</strong> an hour. That being said, please enjoy this sumptuous bolognese!
        </p>
