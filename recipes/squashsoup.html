        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
        <p>The butternut squash soup is an ideal, hot, hearty meal during the frosty winter months. The<br>
        recipe only requires a few ingredients, however you will need an immersion blender. Thankfully,<br>
        you may obtain one at an appliance store or on Amazon for a very reasonable price.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 butternut squash</li>
                <li>2 big carrots</li>
                <li>1 big onion</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Handful of toasted pumpkin seeds</li>
                <li>Cayenne pepper powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of sour cream</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Slice the onion and cook it in a pot with some olive oil and a pinch of salt at medium-low heat until it starts to caramelize.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, remove the seeds and skin from the squash and dice it into small cubes.</li>
                <li>Roughly chop the carrots.</li>
                <li>Once the onion is soft and slightly brown, add the chopped squash and carrots to the pot.</li>
                <li>Add water until it barely submerges the vegetables and cook at high heat for 20-30min.</li>
                <li>Once the vegetables are tender, use the immersion blender to blend the ingredients together until a smooth consistency.</li>
                <li>Adjust the salt level and serve in a bowl with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, a spoon of sour cream, and a handful of toasted pumpkin seeds with your favourite slice of bread on the side - bon app√©tit!</li>
            </ol>
